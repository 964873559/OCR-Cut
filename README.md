How to cut out a letter for OCR?


This repository is to study in cutting out every letter for OCR.

And here I hava got two main algorithms, the one is by projecting and another is by finding counters.

But all these algorithms are not working well, Chinese letter is so difficult to solve.

I will appreate a lot if you got this and thought a better algorithms!
